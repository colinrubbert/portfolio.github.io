blurb: <p><strong>Colin specializes in making things</strong> for human people. Most of the things he makes are <a href="http://colinrubbert.com" target="_blank">digital interfaces</a> and applications, but he also puts effort into crafting beautiful photography, stepping out of his comfort zone to learn new things, and builds <a href="http://community.thefirehoseproject.com" target="_blank">communities</a> for new designers and developers.</p>
